# Berrypicker

This is a library I'm using for my research.
It is not production ready, I don't really expect you using it.

I DO know that Python suits better for data science. However for my small experiments JS is enough.
I DO know I'm mixing functional and unit tests here. However I have no time to invest in decoupling those tests and splitting into small unit ones.

## How to use:
No production ready. See tests folder for instructions.

## How to contribute:
I'm open for contributions. Please keep everything modular and small.

## Roadmap:
- Add more specific fetchers
- Implement array-like Map, Filter, Reduce for Cheerio. "Each" with context needs to be encapsulated and forgotten
- Add more useful helpers.
- Add recursive folder checking
- Write more tests
- Write documentation
- Use own website for testing
